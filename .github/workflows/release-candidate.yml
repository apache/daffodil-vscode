name: Release Candidate

# We build release candidates using GitHub actions when a rc* tag is pushed.
# Once the vote passes for a release candidate we promote that candidate to the
# final release--we do not do a new build for final release tags. When
# triggered via workflow_dispatch the release candidate action disables
# publishing regardless of the publish setting--it should be used for testing only
