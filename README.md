# VS Code Daffodil Debug

This is a VS Code extension which enables the interactive debugging of DFDL schema parsing using [Apache Daffodil](https://daffodil.apache.org/).

  * using the "Extensions: Install from VSIX" command from within VS Code (open the Command Palette with Shift-Command-P, then type `vsix` to bring up the command and pointing it at the downloaded `vsix` file); or
  * on the command-line via `code --install-extension <path-to-downloaded-vsix>`.
